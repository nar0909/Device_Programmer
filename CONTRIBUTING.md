### Before you Contribute:
I would like to thank you for your time testing or using the tool from my repo.

Although the Device_Programmer tool works on most SAMD boards i have tested, there might be cases where it may fail to satisfy the purpose it was built for.

I would love to have active contributors involved to make this more user friendly and be able to support vast family of Atmel processors.

### How it all started
I wanted to update firmware onto clients computer over remote/desktop sharing softwares so i have designed this and put it onto the cloud storage
and updated the clients device connected to his computer and clean up my files after the update.


### Feel free to Test:
Please use the tool to test to see if it works on your SAMD board that uses bossac.exe cmd line tools.

### Have Issues?
Please give me a brief request stating:
1.What SAMD board was used?
2.Output screenshots after update if any?
3.Any would like/must have features to the Device_Programmer tool itself.

### Bigger and Better?
If you are interested in expanding the tool not only limited to bossac supported SAMD boards, but also want to add stk500/avrdude/similar tools to make this repo 
to support huge collections of boards and make it better for the open source community users then please do write to me at
narenprathipati@hotmail.com so that I can add the source code to the existing repo.
